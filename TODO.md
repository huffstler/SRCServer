# Things to do still:

### Next
- Static rules logic
- Assigning points based on rules
- Saving points to db

### Short Term
- Finish the rest of the *Assembler classes for each of the packages
- Api sanity testing using Bruno

### Long Term
- Figure out how to serialize dynamic "rules" to save to database
- Testing. Maybe?
